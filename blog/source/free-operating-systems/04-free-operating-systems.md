## Definition: Free Operating System
My personal preference when it comes to PC operating systems are free, Unix-like ones such as FreeBSD, Linux, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Although Windows NT and OS X dominate the usage share of PC operating systems, with Linux taking up less than 2% of the usage share overall. This article is devoted to **free operating systems** and by free I mean they satisfy the following criteria:

* They **cost the end-user absolutely nothing** to download the installation media and install.
* They are at least **predominantly made of open-source software** (OSS). Any non-OSS included in this system is at least freeware and **not** trialware or freemium.
