## &#42;BSDs
The free **&#42;BSDs** are usually used by more advanced users, especially users working on servers. This is because of three main factors:

1. They almost universally need to be installed and configured from the command-line. The most notable exceptions are desktop-oriented FreeBSD derivatives such as GhostBSD and PC-BSD. Even with these systems, the command-line is still an integral part to the system and must be used for more advanced tasks.
2. While some may support a graphical user interface (GUI), such as KDE Plasma or GNOME, most require a pretty solid understanding of the command-line in order for one to get the stage of being able to use a GUI.
3. They are minority operating systems for PCs, that are used even less frequently than Linux, hence fewer popular applications such as Netflix and Spotify are officially supported by them. This lack of popularity also means that free support can be more challenging to get off forums, Q&A websites, *etc.*

I personally have used the following &#42;BSDs (all from the safety of a VirtualBox VM, though, so my experience is numbered in minutes or, at most, hours):

* **DragonFlyBSD** &mdash; this one I have the least experience with.
* **FreeBSD** &mdash; this one I have the greatest level of experience with.
* **GhostBSD** &mdash; this one I have used for at most an hour. Mostly because it is comparatively out-of-date compared to the other desktop-oriented FreeBSD derivative, PC-BSD, that I have used. Despite this, if you want to ease yourself into using a &#42;BSD system from a background of using Windows or other GUI-oriented operating systems (like OS X and more beginner-friendly Linux distributions like Ubuntu), I would definitely suggest you start with GhostBSD or, at-least PC-BSD.
* **NetBSD** &mdash; I have hardly used this one, a fact best illustrated by the fact that I have not yet figured out how to do package management on it.
* **OpenBSD** &mdash; this one I have used more than NetBSD, but still have &lt;2 hours experience with.
* **PC-BSD** &mdash; this one is second to FreeBSD, in terms of my level of experience with it.

The older &#42;BSDs: DragonflyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD are all devoid of a GUI by default, rather they need to be installed from the command-line. Fortunately, however, they also all come with command-line installers that vastly simplify the process of installing them. Of them FreeBSD is, by far, the most popular and also the easiest to work with, in my limited experience. FreeBSD also has better documentation, in my opinion, than other &#42;BSDs.
