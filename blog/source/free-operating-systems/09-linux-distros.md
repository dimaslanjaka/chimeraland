## Linux Distributions
**Linux distributions** are the systems I have far greater experience with, in fact, in the past four years since I started using Ubuntu on my old Dell Laptop, I would say that at least 60% of my time on a PC has been spent using Linux. Hence I will speak at greater length about them, than about the &#42;BSDs. The Linux distributions I have used on an actual computer (as opposed to on a virtual machine) include (with an estimate of how long I spent using each):

* **Arch Linux** &mdash; which I am presently using and have spent at least three months using as my primary OS.
* **Fedora** &mdash; which I have spent less than a week using.
* **Manjaro Linux** &mdash; which I have spent at most a fortnight using.
* **openSUSE Tumbleweed** &mdash; which I have spent about a fortnight using.
* **Sabayon Linux** &mdash; I spent >3 months using this system.
* **Ubuntu** &mdash; I spent roughly 1-3 years using this one (on and off, I switched a lot between it and Windows 7)

while those I have used on a virtual machine (not including those I have also used on an actual computer) are far more numerous and are mentioned in a list on the [About Me Page](https://fusion809.github.io/about-me/) of this blog. When someone ask a Linux enthusiast, "What's the best Linux distribution?" The Linux enthusiast will quite often roll their eyes, as the question is akin to asking, "What's the best food?" There maybe a best distribution (or analogously a best food item) for an individual person, in a particular context or situation, but there is no "best distribution", in general. My favourite distributions would be Arch Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed and Sabayon Linux, but that is with regard to how I use them and not a general, all-situation-inclusive assessment of them.

The best distribution for you will depend on several variables, including:

* How you use your computer, day-to-day. Do you spend most of your time using web browsers, office suites, music players, video players, gaming software, *etc.* or do you spend your time developing software of your own or building packages?
