## Free &#42;nix Systems
Presently the most popular free &#42;nix operating systems can be split into the following two categories:

* &#42;BSDs such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD and derivatives thereof.
* Linux distributions

the remaining free &#42;nix systems are less popular and include Redox. This post will pay vastly more attention to the Linux distributions and &#42;BSDs, than these minority free &#42;nix systems.
