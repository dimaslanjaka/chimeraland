## Definition: Unix and Unix-like
What defines a **Unix system** is its compliance to any version of the **Single Unix Specification** (**SUS**). The basic requirements set forth in these standards include that the system has a specified set of command-line utilities that each serve one and only one, narrowly and well-defined function. Additionally they also need a specialized command-line interpreter known as a Unix shell, that also needs to fulfill certain criteria. Unix shells also share significant similarities in their syntax.

**Unix-like operating systems**, however, have all the characteristic features of a Unix system but have not been certified as compliant to any version of the SUS. This is usually due to financial reasons. See SUS compliance certification costs money and many Unix-like operating systems are community-developed with no significant financial backing.

Other authors will use the terminology Un&#42;x or &#42;nix to refer to Unix-like operating-systems, while I use it to refer to both Unix and Unix-like operating systems, as it saves an awful lot of space and time as opposed to me continually writing Unix/Unix-like operating system all the time.
